# CBIT-research-internship

This repository contains the projects and work completed during my research internship at **Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology (CBIT)**.  
The primary project is **PillTalk**, an AI-powered web application designed to assist users by reading and translating handwritten medical prescriptions.

## 💊 Project: PillTalk – AI Prescription Translator

**PillTalk** is an elder-friendly medical translator designed to bridge the communication gap between doctors' handwritten prescriptions and patients.  

Users can upload an image of a prescription, and the application uses advanced AI to read the handwriting, extract key information, and present it in **simple, easy-to-understand English**, complete with **audio playback** of the instructions.
